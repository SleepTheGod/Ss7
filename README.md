SS7 Attack Framework Setup Script:

This script automates the setup of an SS7 attack framework by installing and configuring essential tools and dependencies.
It installs Wireshark for packet analysis, SCTPScan for SCTP device detection, GNU Radio Companion for signal processing, OpenSS7 for SS7 protocol stack implementation, and Asterisk with SS7 support for VoIP services.
Additionally, it clones and builds other SS7 testing tools from GitHub repositories.

SIGTRAN Adaptation Setup Script:

This script facilitates the setup of SIGTRAN (Signaling Transport) adaptation by installing and configuring relevant software components.
It installs necessary dependencies such as libssl-dev and then proceeds to install and configure OpenSS7, an open-source implementation of the SS7 protocol stack.
Additionally, it installs and configures SCTPScan, a tool for detecting and scanning SCTP-enabled devices, to complement the SIGTRAN adaptation setup.
These scripts streamline the process of setting up environments for SS7 testing and SIGTRAN adaptation, automating the installation and configuration of required software components and dependencies. They serve as efficient tools for researchers and practitioners in the field of telecommunications security and signaling protocols.
